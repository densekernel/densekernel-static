During COVID-19, we witnessed an unprecendented rise in misinformation, largely in the form of viral health claims. Whilst the economic benefit of the spread of such information is not always immediately apparent, the risk is clear. In a similar respect to the flattening of the curve of the pandemic, collective effort is required to protect against the perils of the spread of dangerous information. It is essential to provide appropriate warnings in order to provide a platform where reliable, authentic information can thrive. I believe that software is part of the solution and I am pleased to be starting CheckStep with Guillaume Bouchard and a research team who are leaders in their respective fields to provide tools to those building online communities.

Where possible, we would like to build in public and look forward to sharing further updates.
